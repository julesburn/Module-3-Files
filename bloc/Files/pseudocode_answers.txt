Short Answer
Why do programmers use pseudocode?

To help them organize and visualize the problem they're trying to solve and break it down into smaller, ordered steps.

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Nothing, it's not code. Depending what was entered, it might throw an error.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.
INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is greater:
PRINT first number
ELSE
PRINT second number

Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
WHILE the number is less than 101:
START at 0
PRINT the number
ADD 1 to the number
END the loop

Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

INPUT the search query
FOR the entries in the phonebook:
IF the search query matches an entry:
RETURN the entry


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
