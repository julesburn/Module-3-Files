>What is npm and what does it do?

`npm` is the Node.js Package Manager. It hosts thousands of free packages to download and use. This tool is accessed through the command line and is used to interact with a huge repository of Node.js projects.

>What kind of information does package.json hold?

The `package.json` is a file that communicates to `npm` how a Node application is structured.

>Google another Node package. Using the demo directory run npm install <theNameOfThePackage> --save. Check the contents of your package.json file to make sure that the dependencies list the name of the Node package.
